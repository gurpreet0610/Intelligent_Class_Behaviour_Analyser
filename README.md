# Intelligent_Class_Behaviour_Analyser
#### A smart analyser that analyses the behaviour of audience while someone is giving presentations or of students while a teacher is teaching or any seminar is held. 
It works by live video streaming in which live video stream is broke into frames at server-side and then by application of facial recognition algorithm face detection of the person and simultaneously facial expression and behavioural detection is being done. And of this analysis dynamic graphs are being plotted which gives the measure of how good a presentation is. When the difference of earlier and current value point increases above a certain threshold value then it gives the smart suggestion to the user or speaker to improve his presentation like either by cracking some jokes or become more interactive so the audience pay more attention to the speaker.
##### System live streams the video of the classroom,identifies the faces among the students for different frames and analyse the behaviour of the student
It records the facial expressions of the students and logs whether they look happy, upset, angry, fearful or disgusted. The information collected by system is analyzed and reported to teachers so they can better supervise the performance of their students.
